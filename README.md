# EmojiHub Client

This repository contains the three versions of the same client for the [EmojiHub REST API](https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub).

The three implementations are:

- [React](https://github.com/portrik/emojihub-client/tree/react)
- [Solid](https://github.com/portrik/emojihub-client/tree/solid)
- [Svelte](https://github.com/portrik/emojihub-client/tree/svelte)

All of them were put together over a weekend as a fun trial to get a feel for Solid and Svelte. The design is very much makeshift and requires more love. There may be some bugs as well, I have not added any tests.

There is a [Marp](https://marp.app/) presentation as well to accompany my feelings about the two frameworks. The presentation is only meant to be presented to my colleagues during our knowledge sharing session.
